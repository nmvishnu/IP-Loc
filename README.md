# IP-Location
Retrieves IP Locations of IP List

Use -h for help
-i for input file (list containing IPs)
-o for output file (list with Geolocation and IPs)

Whois and ipapi is separate scripts.
Whois is not always accurate but has no limit.
IP api is more accurate but has daily limit (1000 IPs).

These scripts was created because I was lazy. Please don't expect maintenance.
